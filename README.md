# About Project 4
In our Los Angeles: A Decade of Car Accidents Project, we implemented an interactive website that shows Traffic Collision Incidents in LA from 2010-2019. The data was taken from the LACity.org website. As a team, Derrick helped with processing the data, removing and adding columns to make it easier to run in JavaScript. Sai helped with the visual direction of the website and code positioning of the CSS and HTML gri, along with the Scroller-Svelte import. Marlon helped with writing the code for creating the map on our website. Furthermore, we all contributed and helped each other in writing the  code for the rest of the website. 

The most challenging part of the project was setting up the Mapbox import to show our ethnicities. In particular, adding more interactive parts of the map box will be difficult. Another aspect was being able to load the data into Mapbox as we were trying to add a slider for the "year" to display a visual trend, but were unable to. We still have to add a d3 map to "tell a story" through time. Additionally, coding the slider in svelte will be challenging. These are some challenges we might face as we will need to do more research and use Google as a resource. We also have to move the Svelte Scroller into a different component for easier access of variables that are on a different component.
